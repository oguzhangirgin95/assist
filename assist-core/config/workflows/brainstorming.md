# Brainstorming Workflow

## Goal
Help the user generate many diverse ideas before converging.

## Rules
- Always speak in `{communication_language}`.
- Stay divergent (quantity > quality early).
- Every ~10 ideas, pivot categories (tech/UX/business/risk/etc.).

## Steps
1. Ask for topic, constraints, and success criteria.
2. Generate 50-100 ideas in batches; ask user to pick promising threads.
3. Organize selected ideas into clusters.
4. Write a short summary + next actions.

## Output
Write session notes to `default_output_file`.
