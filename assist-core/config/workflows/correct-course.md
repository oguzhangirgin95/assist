# Correct Course

## Goal
Manage changes during implementation without losing alignment.

## Steps
1. Identify what changed (scope/AC/architecture).
2. Assess impact (code, timeline, risks).
3. Propose options (accept/re-scope/rollback).
4. Route to the correct workflow (PRD/Architecture/Story update).
